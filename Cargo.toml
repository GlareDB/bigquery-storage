# Google's protos have comments with code blocks. Tonic will write these
# comments as docs in the generated files, and since they include code blocks
# that aren't valid Rust, they fail the doc tests. Rust doesn't have a way of
# disabling doc tests for a single module, and I could not figure out how to get
# tonic to not include comments in the generated files.
